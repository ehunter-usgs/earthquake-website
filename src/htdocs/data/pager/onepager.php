  PAGER provides shaking and loss estimates following significant earthquakes
  anywhere in the world. These estimates are generally available within 30
  minutes and are updated as more information becomes available. Rapid estimates
  include the number of people and names of cities exposed to each shaking
  intensity level as well as the likely ranges of fatalities and economic
  losses. PAGER does not consider secondary effects such as landslides,
  liquefaction, and tsunami in loss estimates at this time. For tsunami warnings
  see <a href="http://tsunami.noaa.gov">http://tsunami.noaa.gov/</a>
</p>
<p>
Information on the extent of shaking will be uncertain in the minutes and
hours following an earthquake and typically improves as additional sensor data
and reported intensities are acquired and incorporated into models of the
earthquakeâ€™s source. Users of PAGER need to account for uncertainty and
always seek the most current PAGER release for any earthquake.

	<li>
    <a name="A"></a><strong>Summary of the basic earthquake
		parameters</strong>, including origin time, local time, magnitude,
		hypocenter, and the name of the region where the earthquake took
		place. For events with high likelihood of a tsunami, a link to the
		NOAA tsunami Web page is provided (bold red text).
  </li>
	<li>
    <a name="B"></a><strong>Earthquake Impact Scale summary alert level
		</strong>. The higher of the two alert levels (<a href="#D">D</a>) is
		shown as the summary alert at the top-center of the page.
  </li>
	<li>
    <a name="C"></a><strong>The version of the PAGER alert and the time the
		alert was created</strong>. New versions of the alert are generated when
		the earthquake information is improved as supplemental ground-shaking
		constraints become available.
  </li>
	<li>
    <a name="D"></a><strong>Earthquake Impact Scale alert levels</strong>
		for fatalities (left) and economic losses (right). The alert levels are
		based on the range of most likely losses; the uncertainty in the alert
		level can be gauged by the histogram, depicting the percent likelihood
		that adjacent alert levels (or fatality/loss ranges) occur. Accompanying
		text clarifies the nature of the alert based on experience from past
		earthquakes. If the economic alert is yellow or greater, the text will
		also give a range of economic losses in terms of the country's Gross
		Domestic Product. The higher level of the two alerts is shown as the
		summary alert at the top-center of the page (<a href="#B">B</a>).
  </li>
	<li>
    <a name="E"></a><strong>Table showing population exposed</strong> to
		different Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) levels and the possible
		damage at different intensity levels for resistant and vulnerable
		structures. MMI describes the severity of an earthquake in terms of its
		effect on humans and structures and is a rough measure of the amount of
		shaking at a given location. Unlike earthquake magnitude, intensity
		varies with distance from the fault. Population outside the map bounds
		are not included in the totals.
  </li>
	<li>
    <a name="F"></a><strong>Map of MMI contours</strong> plotted over the
		Landscan (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) population base map. The
		regions labeled with Roman numeral MMI values are separated by half
		intensity unit contour lines, e.g., 5.5, 6.5, 7.5. The total population
		exposure to a given MMI value is obtained by summing the population
		between the thick contour lines. This total is shown in the population
		exposure table (<a href="#E">E</a>).
  </li>
	<li>
    <a name="G"></a><strong>Region-specific structure and earthquake
		commentary</strong>. The Structures comment may contain the most
		vulnerable building type(s) in the region or a general description of
		the vulnerability of the buildings in the region. The Historical
		Earthquakes section includes a table of population exposure and
		fatalities for three previous nearby earthquakes and, in some cases, the
		potential for fires, landslides, liquefaction, or other hazards, based
		on past earthquakes in the region, will be noted.
  </li>
	<li>
    <a name="H"></a><strong>Table of MMI estimates for selected
		settlements</strong>. A maximum of 11 settlements that fall within the
		map boundary are included in the table. The table contains country
		capitals and the six settlements with the highest estimated intensity.
		The remaining settlements listed are selected by population. Settlement
		name, location and population are obtained from the freely-available
		<a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a> geographical database.
  </li>
	<li>
    <a name="I"></a><strong>Footer</strong>, including a link to the PAGER
		web page, event identification information, and a disclaimer noting that
		the content was automatically generated, and has additional sources of
		uncertainty. All possible uncertainties are not considered in the
		determination of estimated earthquake fatalities and economic losses;
		the actual impact of the earthquake may differ from PAGER's
		automatically generated estimate.
