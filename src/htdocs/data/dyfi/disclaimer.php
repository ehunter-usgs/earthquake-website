  	Some USGS information accessed through this page may be preliminary in nature
  	and presented prior to final review and approval by the Director of the USGS.
  	This information is provided with the understanding that it is not guaranteed
  	to be correct or complete, and conclusions drawn from such information are
  	the sole responsibility of the user.
  </li>
  <li>
  	These are automatic computer generated maps and have not necessarily been
  	checked by human oversight, so they may contain errors. Further, the input
  	data for these maps are taken directly from the community of Internet users.
  	While we make efforts to sort out unusual individual observations, the
  	&ldquo;net&rdquo; product may still contain errors.
  </li>
  <li>
  	These maps are preliminary in nature and they will be updated frequently as
  	data is supplemented by additional observations. It is important to reload
  	your browser to see the update.
  </li>
  <li>
  	Locations within the same intensity area will not necessarily experience
  	the same level of damage since damage depends heavily on the type of
  	structure, the nature of the construction, and the details of the ground
  	motion at that site, whereas a CIIM intensity value is intended to represent
  	an average value for an entire ZIP code region. For this reason more or less
  	damage than described in the intensity scale may occur.
  </li>
  <li>
  	Intensities assigned by Internet users alone are not official USGS Modified
  	Mercalli Intensities. While calibrated to agree with the USGS MMI in some
  	average sense, the should not be considered equivalent to the USGS MMI.
  	Intensities reaching the damaging range (VI or higher) can only be considered
  	reliable and authoritative if validated by the designated representative of
  	the U.S. Geological Survey. This is not the case for these Internet
  	user-based maps.
  </li>
  <li>
  	At present, the procedure for preparing the CIIM is new and experimental.
  	Some aspects of the procedure may change in the future.

  	<b>Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</b> The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
  	(44 U.S.C. 3501 et. seq.) requires us to inform you that this information is
  	being collected to supplement instrumental data and to promote public safety
  	through better understanding of earthquakes. Response to this request is
  	voluntary. Public reporting for this form is estimated to average 6 minutes
  	per response, including the time for reviewing instructions and completing
  	the form. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not
  	required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a
  	currently valid OMB Control Number. Comments regarding this collection of
  	information should be directed to: Bureau Clearance officer, U.S. Geological
  	Survey, 807 National Center, Reston, VA 20192.
