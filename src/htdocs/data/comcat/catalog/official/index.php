The USGS formed a working group in 2000 to address the need for a uniform policy on the accurate,
consistent, and understandable reporting of earthquake size. The working group completed its task
toward the end of 2001, resulting in the above policy being implemented in early 2002. The working
group was decommissioned following the release of the policy and updates to the
"Magnitude of Significant Earthquakes" is maintained by the USGS National Earthquake Information
Center. Members of the USGS Earthquake Magnitude Working Group were:

<ul>
<li>William Bakun (co-chair) USGS, Menlo Park</li>
<li>Joan Gomberg USGS, Memphis</li>
<li>Lucille Jones USGS, Pasadena</li>
<li>Hiroo Kanamori Caltech</li>
<li>David Oppenheimer USGS, Menlo Park</li>
<li>Anthony Qamar University of Washington</li>
<li>Stuart Sipkin (co-chair) USGS, Golden</li>
<li>Craig Weaver USGS, Seattle</li>
</ul>

<p>
The USGS Earthquake Magnitude Working Group compiled a list of significant,
past earthquakes for which reliable magnitude estimates are available.
This list is not static and will be reviewed annually by the National
Earthquake Information Center and revised as new research and results
become available.
